# Sprites

Sprites are from https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto, using color 
tweaking by me to give a static color before converting with spritezero-cli 
(https://github.com/mapbox/spritezero-cli). The original CC0 license of openstreetmap-carto 
(same as the openstreetmap-mapboxgl) applies to the raw sprites and the pbf versions. 

# Fonts

The Open Sans font family is used for this style:
